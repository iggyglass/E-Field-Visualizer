                <ul>
                    <li>Left click to add charges (up to <span class="max-charges">??</span>)</li>
                    <li>Right click to remove charges</li>
                    <li>Click and drag to move charges</li>
                    <li>Use the slider on the right to change the charge of the next charge</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The voltage at your cursor is displayed on the right side of the screen. Red
                    equipotential lines indicate a positive electric potential whereas blue equipotential
                    lines indicate a negative electric potential.

                    Note that this webapp requires a modern(ish) browser that supports WebGL along with the
                    WebGL standard derivatives extension. With the probable exception of Internet Explorer,
                    any browser from nearly the last 10 years should work. Also your browser should support
                    Javascript (of course).
                </p>
                <p>
                    If the webapp is running a bit slow and you have field lines enabled, try disabling them
                    while you place your charges, as drawing the lines is costly.
                    (<a href="#field-line-rendering-why">Why?</a>) Additionally, it may help to turn on
                    Hardware Acceleration in your browser's settings.

                        In short, drawing the field lines is handled on the CPU, in Javascript, and drawing
                        everything else in the visualization is handled on the GPU, in GLSL. For the vector
                        field and the equipotential lines, the color of each pixel is <i>primarily</i>
                        dependent upon the the positions and strengths of all the charges on screen and not
                        on the surrounding pixels, allowing us to write a shader, in GLSL, to compute all
                        these values in <i>parallel</i> to one another to make the webapp run more
                        efficiently. The field lines however, need to be traced out which, by nature, isn't
                        really something you can parallelize to each pixel on the screen. As such, those are
                        done sequentially in Javascript and will thus take much longer to render than the
                        equipotential lines and vector field. (<a href="#field-line-rendering-why">Why?</a>)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there's a slight complication on the GPU side of things. Remember how I said
                        the pixel colors were <i>primarily</i> dependent on the charges, not <i>entirely</i>
                        dependent? Well, it turns out that the equipotential lines need to rely partially on
                        values computed by the neighboring pixels. Namely, since \(\vec{E}=-\nabla V\), one
                        way to think about equipotential lines in 2D are as topographical lines on a map
                        where the electric potential, \(V\), represents the height of your terrain and
                        \(\vec{E}\) is your (downward) slope &mdash; this is important because it means if we
                        were to simply assign a color to every point with a given potential (or more
                        precisely, a color to every point <i>within some \(\varepsilon\)</i> of a potential),
                        our line would change in thickness depeding on the slope of our potential function at
                        that point (e.g., a smaller slope makes a thicker line and a larger slope makes a
                        thinner line). One way to solve this is to normalize our \(\varepsilon\) against the
                        screen-space gradient of our potential function. Unfortunately, estimating a
                        derivative requires knowledge of neighboring values
                        <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(\(\frac{\mathrm{d}y}{\mathrm{d}x}\approx\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)),</span>
                        yet GPUs run each pixel in parallel to one another, normally with no way to
                        communicate between pixels, creating a dilemma. Fortunately however, pixels
                        <i>are</i> run in batches, and GLSL is able to exploit this behind the scenes to
                        estimate first-order screen-space derivatives for us. Specifically, for some computed
                        scalar, \(p\), there is a GLSL function, \(\mathrm{fwidth}(p)\), such that
                        \begin{equation}
                            \mathrm{fwidth}(p):=\left|\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\right|+\left|\frac{\partial p}{\partial y}\right|,
                        \end{equation}
                        which is <i>just</i> what we need to normalize the width of our lines. This allows
                        the equipotential lines to be drawn (nicely) on the GPU, saving precious CPU time
                        (<i>and</i> why the webapp needs the standard derivatives extension to run).

                    <p>
                        Additionally, since the E-field is calculated by taking the superposition of the
                        E-field contributions of <i>all</i> the charges on screen (something which is
                        inherently an \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) operation) and GLSL needs to be able to unroll loops
                        at compile-time (due to the nature of GPU architecture), there needs to be a hard
                        limit on the number of charges visible at any given time. Currently, this hard limit
                        is <span class="max-charges">??</span> and any additional charges will simply
                        replace the eldest charges.

                    <h3>Why is drawing the field lines so costly?</h3>
                    <p>
                        There's no <i>great</i> way to do field lines on the GPU, unlike the equipotentials
                        and vector field. This is because drawing the field lines requires tracing a path
                        <i>through</i> the vector field, which is an inherently sequential operation and not
                        one that can be run independently for each pixel on the screen in parallel. Likewise,
                        although the code could be written more efficiently, as it stands the operation
                        scales <i>cubically</i> with the number of charges on screen
                        <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(\(\mathcal{O}(n^3)\),</span> due to the
                        charge-intersection checks as well as the vector field calculation, which is
                        \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) in and of itself) and linearly with the number of points in each
                        line <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(\(\mathcal{O}(n)\)).</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One possible optimization would be to run each <i>line</i> in parallel or at the very
                        least asynchronously, but doing so would likely create many headaches in terms of
                        programming, hence the field line rendering stays as it is for now.

                        <h4>How are the field lines <i>currently</i> rendered?</h4>
                        <p>
                            For each charge on screen, a number of evenly-spaced field lines,
                            <span id="field-line-num">??</span>, are "emitted." If the charge is positive,
                            the angle of the first field line is given by \(\frac{2\pi}{n}\), if negative
                            then \(\frac{2\pi}{n}+\frac{\pi}{n}\). For each line, the vector at the current
                            point in the electric field, \(\vec{E}\), is calculated as the superposition of
                            all the E-field contributions of each charge, \(q_i\), considering their position
                            relative to the current point, \(\vec{r_i}\)
                            <span style="white-space:nowrap;">(\(\vec{E}=\sum\limits_i k\frac{q_i}{|\vec{r_i}|^2}\hat{r}\)).</span>
                            \(\vec{E}\) is then normalized and multiplied by a constant scaling factor (so
                            all step sizes are the same length) and this resultant vector is added to our
                            position to obtain the position of our next step (and a line is drawn between the
                            previous position and the new position). This process of calculating the E-field
                            at the current position and taking a step in that direction is performed for
                            (currently) <span id="field-line-iterations">??</span> interations, or until the
                            line intersects with a charge.
